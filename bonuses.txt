BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

We are entitled to this bonus.

	1. We didn't use any magic numbers, and use all the configuration fields.
	2. Dealer:
		-Dealer constructor (TurnTimeOutMillis, deckSize)
		-placeCardsOnTable (tableSize)
		-updateTimerDisplay (TurnTimeOutMillis, TurnTimeOutWarningMillis)
		-removeAllCardsFromTable (tableSize)
	   Player:
		-run (players)
		-createArtificialIntelligence (players, tableSize)
		-terminate (players)
		-point (pointFreezeMillis)
		-penalty (penaltyFreezeMillis)
	   Table:
		-Table constructor (tableSize, deckSize)
		-placeCard (tableDelayMillis)
		-removeCard (tableDelayMillis)
	3. We look at the code and checked that each one of the coniguration fields is used in our code.

--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

We are entitled to this bonus.

	1. Every thread that we create, is in charge for creating and terminating another thread by order.
	2. Dealer: run, terminate
	   Player: run, terminate, createArtificialIntelligence
	3. We looked at the log files and checked the INFO meesseges.

--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

We are not entitled to this bonus.

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

We are not entitled to this bonus.
